    <h1>WhisperClone Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 5, 2025</p>

    <p>HavanaDev ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how WhisperClone handles your information.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>WhisperClone is designed with privacy as a core principle.</strong> Your voice recordings and transcriptions are processed locally on your device whenever possible. We do not collect, store, or have access to your audio recordings or transcribed text.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Audio Recordings:</strong> Your voice recordings are never uploaded to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Transcriptions:</strong> The text generated from your speech stays on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect names, emails, or other personal identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> We do not track how you use the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We do not access your location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How the App Works</h2>
    
    <h3>On-Device Processing (Default)</h3>
    <p>By default, WhisperClone uses Apple's built-in Speech Recognition framework, which processes your voice entirely on your device. No data is sent to external servers.</p>

    <h3>Local Whisper AI</h3>
    <p>When using the Local Whisper option, all AI processing happens on your device using downloaded model files. Your audio never leaves your device.</p>

    <h3>OpenAI Integration (Optional)</h3>
    <p>If you choose to use OpenAI's Whisper API:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Audio is sent to OpenAI's servers for transcription</li>
        <li>You must provide your own API key</li>
        <li>Your API key is stored securely in your device's Keychain</li>
        <li>OpenAI's privacy policy applies to data processed by their service</li>
        <li>We do not have access to your API key or the data you send to OpenAI</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions We Request</h2>
    
    <h3>Microphone Access</h3>
    <p>Required to record your voice for transcription. Audio is processed locally and is not transmitted externally (unless you explicitly choose OpenAI).</p>

    <h3>Speech Recognition</h3>
    <p>Required for Apple's Speech framework to convert your voice to text. Processing occurs on-device.</p>

    <h3>Keyboard Extension (iOS)</h3>
    <p>The keyboard extension requires "Full Access" to function. Even with Full Access enabled, WhisperClone does not transmit any keystrokes or data from the keyboard.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transcription History:</strong> Stored locally on your device in the app's private container.</li>
        <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Stored locally using standard iOS/macOS preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> Stored securely in the system Keychain.</li>
        <li><strong>Downloaded Models:</strong> Stored in the app's Application Support directory.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can delete all local data by uninstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>WhisperClone does not include any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</p>
    <p>If you choose to use OpenAI integration, please review <a href="https://openai.com/privacy/" target="_blank">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>WhisperClone does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The app does not collect personal information from any users.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect personal data, there is no personal data to access, correct, or delete. All your data remains on your device under your control.</p>
